# 🚀 AtliQ0 Bank Credit Card Analysis Project

## 📌 Project Overview
Welcome to the **AtliQ0 Bank Credit Card Analysis Project**! This project analyzes customer data to determine the optimal age group for launching a new credit card. Using statistical techniques, we provide actionable insights for data-driven decision-making in customer segmentation and marketing strategy.

## 🎯 Objective
Identify the most suitable age group for a new credit card launch based on spending behavior.

## 📊 Techniques Used
- 📈 **Measures of Central Tendency** (Mean, Median, Mode) to identify typical customer spending behavior.
- 🔍 **Z-Test for Hypothesis Testing** to compare spending behavior across age groups.
- 📏 **Confidence Intervals** to assess the reliability of the results.

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies
- 🐍 **Programming Language**: Python
- 🗄 **Database**: MySQL
- 📚 **Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- 📓 **Notebook**: Jupyter Notebooks

## 🔬 Analysis Process
1. 🏗 **Data Preparation**: Cleaned data, handled missing values, and outliers.
2. 📊 **Central Tendency**: Calculated mean, median, and mode to summarize spending behavior.
3. 🔍 **Hypothesis Testing (Z-Test)**: Compared spending between younger (18-30) and older (40+) age groups to test statistical significance.
4. 📏 **Confidence Intervals**: Estimated true population parameters with a confidence level (e.g., 95%).

## 🔢 Key Insights
- 📊 **Central Tendency**: Helped identify the average spending patterns for different age groups.
- 📈 **Z-Test Results**: Determined if older customers (40+) spend significantly more than younger customers (18-30).
- 📏 **Confidence Intervals**: Ensured results were statistically valid and generalizable to the entire customer base.

## 🚀 Impact
This analysis helps **AtliQ0 Bank** make data-driven decisions for customer segmentation, targeted marketing, and strategic product launches. The statistical insights provide a strong foundation for developing the bank’s credit card products.
