# AtliQ0 Bank Credit Card Analysis Project

Welcome to the **AtliQ0 Bank Credit Card Project** repository! This project focuses on analyzing customer data to identify the optimal age groups for releasing a new credit card offering. Using statistical techniques such as **Measures of Central Tendency**, **Hypothesis Testing (Z-Test)**, and **Confidence Levels**, we derive actionable insights to guide business decisions for new product launches.

## ðŸ“Œ **Project Highlights**
- **Objective**: Analyze age group data to determine which segment is best suited for the release of a new credit card product.
- **Methods**: **Hypothesis Testing (Z-Test)**, **Measures of Central Tendency**, **Confidence Level Calculation**.
- **Data Insights**: Identifying key age groups, understanding spending patterns, and validating assumptions for targeted marketing.
- **Tools Used**: Python (Pandas, NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn), Jupyter Notebooks.
- **Business Impact**: Data-driven decision-making for product development and customer segmentation.

## ðŸ“Š **Project Objective**
The primary goal of this project is to analyze the credit card usage and behavior of different **age groups** to determine which demographic is most suitable for the launch of a new credit card. The analysis includes hypothesis testing using a **Z-test** to validate assumptions regarding spending behavior across different age groups.
