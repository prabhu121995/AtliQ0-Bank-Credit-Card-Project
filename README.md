AtliQ0 Bank Credit Card Analysis Project
Welcome to the AtliQ0 Bank Credit Card Project! This repository contains a detailed analysis of customer behavior, credit card usage patterns, and insights derived from statistical techniques. The project was created to explore and analyze data through key statistical methods, which include Measures of Central Tendency, Central Limit Theorem, and Hypothesis Testing.

üìù Project Overview
This project aims to provide actionable insights for AtliQ0 Bank by analyzing credit card data to uncover customer spending habits, credit utilization, and default patterns. The project leverages core statistical methods to derive insights that can drive better decision-making, marketing strategies, and product offerings.

Key Objectives:
Customer Spending Analysis: Understanding the spending patterns of different customer segments.

Credit Utilization Patterns: Exploring how customers utilize credit and the risk factors involved.

Default Prediction: Analyzing factors contributing to credit card defaults and how they can be mitigated.

Statistical Analysis: Applying statistical concepts to make data-driven decisions.

üîß Technologies and Tools Used
Python (Pandas, NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)

Jupyter Notebooks for detailed exploration

GitHub for version control and project management

üìä Techniques Applied
1. Measures of Central Tendency
I applied key measures such as mean, median, and mode to identify trends and outliers in customer spending, payment behavior, and credit utilization. These measures help summarize the dataset and understand general patterns.

2. Central Limit Theorem (CLT)
The Central Limit Theorem was used to demonstrate that sample means of random variables from non-normally distributed data tend to follow a normal distribution. This insight was essential for estimating population parameters from sample data and testing hypotheses with greater confidence.

3. Hypothesis Testing
Various hypotheses were tested to validate assumptions about customer behavior:

Example hypothesis: "Is there a significant difference in spending behavior across age groups?"

Hypothesis testing techniques like t-tests and Chi-square tests were used to evaluate these assumptions, ensuring that decisions were based on statistically sound conclusions.
